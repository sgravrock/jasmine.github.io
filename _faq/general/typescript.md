question: How can I use Jasmine on my TypeScript project?
---

There are two common ways to use Jasmine and TypeScript together. 

The first is to use `@babel/register` to compile TypeScript files to JavaScript 
on the fly as they're imported. See
[Testing a React app with Jasmine NPM]({{ site.github.url }}/tutorials/react_with_npm) for an
example. This approach is easy to set up and provides the fastest possible
edit-compile-run-specs cycle but does not provide type checking by default. You
can add type checking by creating a separate TypeScript config file for your
specs with `noEmit` set to `true`, and running `tsc` on it either before or 
after running your specs.

The second approach is to compile your TypeScript spec files to JavaScript files
on disk and configure Jasmine to run the compiled TypeScript files. This usually
gives a slower edit-compile-run-specs cycle. But it's a more familiar workflow
for people who are used to compiled languages. It's also the only option if you
want to write specs in TypeScript and run them in a browser.
