question: When is the next release of Jasmine?
---

Because Jasmine is maintained in our free time, releases don't always come out in a timely manner. We strive to release a minor version ([versioning strategy](#versions)) every few months, based on the amount of functionality that has been added since the last release. This goal could get moved if we haven't gotten time to add functionality or merge pull requests, as the amount of new functionality since the last release may not seem large enough to warrant a new release. Additionally, though we obviously strive not to break things, when a minor release breaks some functionality, we do our best to get the issues fixed in patch releases as quickly as possible.
