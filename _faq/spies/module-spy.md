question: How can I spy on a property of a module? I'm getting an error like "Property aProperty does not have access type get".

This error means that something (probably a transpiler, but possibly the
JavaScript runtime) has marked the exported properties of the module as
read-only. The ES module spec requires that exported module properties be
read-only, and recently transpilers like TypeScript have moved to conform to
that requirement even when emitting CommonJS modules. If a property is marked
read-only, Jasmine can't replace it with a spy.

There are two ways to work around the problem:

1. Use dependency injection for things you'll want to mock, and inject a spy
or a mock object from the spec. This approach usually results in maintainability
improvements in the specs and the code under test. Needing to mock modules is
often a sign of tightly coupled code, and it can be wise to fix the coupling
rather than work around it with testing tools.
2. If you're running your specs on Node, you can monkey-patch the Node module
loader to make exported properties writeable. Doing this involves interacting
with Node APIs that are currently marked as unstable, so it's a good idea to
use a library that takes care of it for you. Examples include
[testdouble](https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js/blob/main/docs/7-replacing-dependencies.md)
and [rewire](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rewire). Be prepared for the 
possibility that things will break when you upgrade Node.
