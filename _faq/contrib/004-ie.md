question: Why won't my code work in IE? How do I fix it?
---

Internet Explorer lacks support for many newer JavaScript features, as well as
some that haven't been "newer" for a long time. (So do a couple of other old
browsers that Jasmine supports.) For the most part, code that's part of Jasmine
itself can't use those features. Here's a partial list of things that won't
work and more portable features to use instead:

| New feature       | IE compatible substitute|
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Arrow functions   | Plain functions, possibly with the `var self = this` trick |
| `async`/`await`   | Callbacks |
| `Promise      `   | Callbacks |
| `const` and `let` | `var` (but beware of [scoping differences](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var)) |
| Spread operator   | `j$.util.clone` and/or manually copying properties |
| for...of loops    | Indexed for loops, `<collection>.forEach()` |
| Template literals | String concatenation |


The linter that runs after `npm test` will catch most compatibility problems.
But it won't catch everything, so it's a good idea to run the specs in IE,
especially if you're unfamiliar with writing cross-browser code. See
[the contributor's guide](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for instructions on how to set up an IE testing virtual machine.
