question: But it's 2021 now, and IE is an antique. Why do we still have to deal with it?

IE certainly is an antique and it may have very low overall usage, but many
large organizations still use it as their standard browser. Many of Jasmine's
users develop applications for large organizations. This means that IE is
potentially more important to Jasmine's user base than its absolute usage
numbers suggest. Also, we
try not to drop support for browsers except in major releases of Jasmine.
Jasmine's relatively infrequent major releases mean that we sometimes have to
carry support for a browser past the point where it might otherwise make sense
to drop it.
