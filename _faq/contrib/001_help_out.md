question: I want to help out with Jasmine, where should I start?
---

Thanks for your help! The Jasmine team only has limited time to work on Jasmine so we appreciate all the help we get from the community.

#### Pivotal Tracker
We have a [backlog in Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/10606) that we keep up to date with work the Jasmine team wants to get into Jasmine.
Look at the top of the current iteration or backlog column for the prioritized list of functionality.
Unfortunately, PivotalTracker doesn't have a great way to allow for comments and questions on a story for people who aren't already joined into the project.
Hopefully the stories are mostly self-explanatory, but it not please ask a question in the associated github issue (if any), or ask a question on the [developers list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jasmine-js-dev).

#### Github Issues
When github issues are reported that seem like things Jasmine could support, we will label the issue with "ready for work".
This label means that we believe there is enough information included in the conversation for someone to implement on their own.
(We're not always correct, if you have further questions, please ask).
