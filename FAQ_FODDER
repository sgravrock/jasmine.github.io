Infra & CSS:
DONE: * Fix margins between FAQs
DONE: * Fix width of warning boxes in FAQs (e.g. _faq/contrib/005-why-ie.md)
* Fix links to & within FAQs
  * Incl. making sure self-links in headings work
DONE: * Link to the FAQs from the main docs page
DONE: * Better TOC (link to individual FAQs)
* Try to upgrade docco to something that understands jsx
  DONE: * Or failing that, at least don't style jsx as errors
* Check TODOs in all FAQs
* Figure out why some anchorjs links (e.g. Why does Jasmine allow multiple expectation failures in a spec? How can I disable that?) add a new line and others don't
* Add a redundant "Back to FAQ index" link to the bottom of each page
* Either support `code` in FAQ titles or remove it


* Consider whether _faq/contrib/003-es5.md  is too defensive
* Review & rewrite "It’s not possible to write a reliable spec for code that has that problem. If you can’t figure out when it’s finished, then neither can Jasmine."

General testing:
DONE  How can I get Jasmine to fail tests with no assertions?
  	* Why not to rely on this
    * https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/issues/1467 (tests w/o assertions)
DONE Why does Jasmine allow multiple assertion failures? How can I turn that off?
DONE: Should I use arrow or regular functions?
What kinds of testing is Jasmine suited to? Not suited to?
Why can't I treat a describe as an ordered sequence of steps?

Can I/how can I use ES modules?

async:
DONE: Why are errors sometimes associated with the suite or "wrong" spec?
  https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/issues/781 (late async errors. me!)
DONE: Which async style should I prefer? Why?
DONE: Something about putting assertions in a callback
DONE: How do I test e.g. UI that awaits?
DONE: Why can't I mix promises and callbacks?
