Infra & CSS:
* Fix links to & within FAQs
  * Incl. making sure self-links in headings work
* Check TODOs in all FAQs
* Figure out why some anchorjs links (e.g. Why does Jasmine allow multiple expectation failures in a spec? How can I disable that?) add a new line and others don't


* Consider whether _faq/contrib/003-es5.md  is too defensive




Typescript?
	* compile & emit stratetgy (src/jasmine/typescript/standalone-ts)
	* babel & then type-check strategy (jasmine-browser)
	* React approach already documented

Questions we wish were frequently asked:
	* How can I get a quicker response to my issue?
	* How can I get a quicker response to my PR?
