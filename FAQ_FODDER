Infra & CSS:
* Fix links to & within FAQs
  * Incl. making sure self-links in headings work
* Try to upgrade docco to something that understands jsx
  DONE: * Or failing that, at least don't style jsx as errors
* Check TODOs in all FAQs
* Figure out why some anchorjs links (e.g. Why does Jasmine allow multiple expectation failures in a spec? How can I disable that?) add a new line and others don't
* Either support `code` in FAQ titles or remove it


* Consider whether _faq/contrib/003-es5.md  is too defensive
* Review & rewrite "It’s not possible to write a reliable spec for code that has that problem. If you can’t figure out when it’s finished, then neither can Jasmine."

Typescript?
	* compile & emit stratetgy (src/jasmine/typescript/standalone-ts)
	* babel & then type-check strategy (jasmine-browser)
	* React approach already documented
